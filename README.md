###Summary
This is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe aka Noughts and Crosses, built in the Ruby language.
If you would like to read more on the rules of this game: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

I built this game with the following restrictions:
- [x] Playable in 3 modes:
  - [x] Human VS Human
  - [x] Human VS Computer
  - [x] Computer VS Computer
- [ ] When playing against the computer, the computer must never lose
- [x] The user should also have the choice of which player goes first.
