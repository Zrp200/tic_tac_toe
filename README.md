##TicTacToe in Ruby

https://travis-ci.org/zlahham/tic_tac_toe.svg

###Summary
This is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe aka Noughts and Crosses, built in the Ruby language.
If you would like to read more on the rules of this game: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

I built this game with the following restrictions:
- Playable in 3 modes: humanVShuman & humanVScomputer, computerVScomputer
- When playing in the computer mode, the computer must never lose
- The user should also have the choice of which player goes first.
